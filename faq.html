<p><strong>How do your shirts fit? <br>
</strong>They fit great! Our tees are cut for a youthful shape. Most of our garments fit a little snug to flatter almost any body type. If you're not sure what size to get or if you're in-between sizes, we recommend you order one size up. Please check the size chart located on our website to find more info on sizing. We print our shirts locally on American Apparel® and Bella® blank goods. Material information can be found on the product pages. If you have questions about sizing issues, please feel free to contact us for sizes you do not see in our inventory.</p>
<p><strong>Do you carry sizes larger than XL?<br>
</strong>We understand that people come in all shapes and sizes.  We wish we could carry all sizes and have all sizes in stock, but we are still a small company and only have so much space in our shops and wear-house. We currently carry men's sizes S-2XL and womens sizes S-2XL in most products. We are a small boutique company and at this time we do not manufacture our garments and like most companies like ours we are tied to blank t-shirt distributors/wholesalers and the sizes and colors they provide. We can offer larger sizes via special order. Click here for more details about ordering.</p>
<p><strong>Will my new shirts shrink after I wash them?<br>
</strong>We print our designs on a variety of materials ranging from 100% Cotton, 50/50 polyester/cotton blend and 50/25/25 (50% Polyester / 25% Cotton / 25% Rayon) construction.  We do not offer pre-shrunk items. We recommend washing in cool water and hang dry, but that is not necessary, tumble dry on low will help prevent shrinkage.</p>
<p><strong>Do you wholesale?<br>
</strong>We're always excited to hear from new retailers. To be considered for an HelloABQ! wholesale account, please send an email to orders@helloabq.com. Make sure to include a copy of your NM Resale Certificate and links to your website and social media outlets (Facebook, Twitter, Tumblr, etc).</p>
<p><strong>How can I sell my products in your store?</strong><br>If you would like to carry your products in our retail stores, please email via our <a href="{{ site.url }}/about/#contact">contact</a> page to discuss further.</p>
<p><strong>Can I pick up my order from your location?<br>
</strong>At this time we do not have a brick and mortar location. We sell at local markets and events and Yes! We can arrange a pick-up. Please be aware that our shipping is FREE and mail might be the best option.</p>
<p><strong>You sent me the wrong item, the wrong size, or forgot an item!<br>
</strong>We are truly sorry for our mistake! While we try to get things right, we do make mistakes from time to time. Please email us and we will fix the problem for you. </p>
<p><strong>Do you offer custom services? Design or screen printing?<br>
